Before the game, players agree on the amount of the minimum bet, which is called the initial jackpot. Player and banker have their own deck of cards, a deck of banknotes is called a stoss.

Player chooses one of his cards from the deck and put them on the table in a closed form and stakes. He supposed that this card will be on the win position before lose one.

Further, the banker turns his deck face up and shifts the top card half a card to the right so that the pater can see the first and second cards. These cards are called forehead (lose) and sonic (win). After that, the player opens his card for comparison with the open cards of the banker. The suit of the card does not matter.

- If the first card (forehead) in the deck coincides with the card of the player, the bet wins the banker.
- If the first card does not coincide with the card of the player, and the second card (sonic) coincides, then the winner is the player. 
- If neither the forehead and the sonic coincide with the player's card, the banker discards the first two cards on the table. Then the player's card is compared with the third and fourth cards of the deck. Thus, the game continues until you see a player's card in the deck. 

Accordingly, if the card in the deck is odd - the third, fifth, seventh, etc., then the banker won. If the card in the deck is even - the second, fourth, sixth, etc., then the player won. 

In the event that the forehead and the sonic coincide, then the winner is the banker. This situation is called plie.
